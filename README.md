#  18.335J/6.337J: Introduction to Numerical Methods

This is the repository of course materials for the 18.335J/6.337J course at MIT, taught by Prof. [Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/), in Spring 2019.

Syllabus
--------

**Lectures**: Monday/Wednesday/Friday 3–4pm (2-190). **Office Hours:** Thursday 4–5pm (2-345).

**Topics**: Advanced introduction to numerical linear algebra and related numerical methods. Topics include direct and iterative methods for linear systems, eigenvalue decompositions and QR/SVD factorizations, stability and accuracy of numerical algorithms, the IEEE floating-point standard, sparse and structured matrices, and linear algebra software. Other topics may include memory hierarchies and the impact of caches on algorithms, nonlinear optimization, numerical integration, FFTs, and sensitivity analysis. Problem sets will involve use of [Julia](http://julialang.org/), a Matlab-like environment (little or no prior experience required; you will learn as you go).

**Prerequisites**: Understanding of linear algebra ([18.06](http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/), [18.700](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-700Fall-2005/CourseHome/), or equivalents). 18.335 is a graduate-level subject, however, so much more mathematical maturity, ability to deal with abstractions and proofs, and general exposure to mathematics is assumed than for 18.06!

**Textbook**: The primary textbook for the course is [_Numerical Linear Algebra_ by Trefethen and Bau](http://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Lloyd-Trefethen/dp/0898713617). ([Readable online](http://owens.mit.edu:8888/sfx_local?bookid=9436&rft.genre=book&sid=Barton:Books24x7) with MIT certificates.)

**Other Reading**: Previous terms can be found in [branches of the 18335 git repository](https://github.com/mitmath/18335/branches). The [course notes from 18.335 in much earlier terms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-335j-introduction-to-numerical-methods-fall-2010/) can be found on OpenCourseWare. For a review of iterative methods, the online books [Templates for the Solution of Linear Systems](http://www.netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/Templates.html) (Barrett et al.) and [Templates for the Solution of Algebraic Eigenvalue Problems](http://www.cs.utk.edu/~dongarra/etemplates/book.html) are useful surveys.

**Grading**: 33% problem sets (about six, ~biweekly). 33% **take-home mid-term exam** (posted Monday **Apr. 8** and due Tuesday **Apr. 9**), 34% **final project** (one-page proposal due Friday March 22, project due Wednesday **May 15**).

* Psets will be [submitted electronically via Stellar](https://learning-modules.mit.edu/gradebook/index.html?uuid=/course/18/sp19/18.335).  Submit a good-quality PDF *scan* of any handwritten solutions and *also* a PDF *printout* of a Julia notebook of your computational solutions.

**TA:** [Sung Woo Jeong](http://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=1782).

**Collaboration policy**: Talk to anyone you want to and read anything you want to, with three exceptions: First, you **may not refer to homework solutions from the previous terms** in which I taught 18.335. Second, make a solid effort to solve a problem on your own before discussing it with classmates or googling. Third, no matter whom you talk to or what you read, write up the solution on your own, without having their answer in front of you.

**Final Projects**: The final project will be a 8–15 page paper (single-column, single-spaced, ideally using the style template from the [_SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis_](http://www.siam.org/journals/auth-info.php)), reviewing some interesting numerical algorithm not covered in the course. \[Since this is not a numerical PDE course, the algorithm should _not_ be an algorithm for turning PDEs into finite/discretized systems; however, your project _may_ take a PDE discretization as a given "black box" and look at some other aspect of the problem, e.g. iterative solvers.\] Your paper should be written for an audience of your peers in the class, and should include example numerical results (by you) from application to a realistic problem (small-scale is fine), discussion of accuracy and performance characteristics (both theoretical and experimental), and a fair comparison to at **least one competing algorithm** for the same problem. Like any review paper, you should _thoroughly reference_ the published literature (citing both original articles and authoritative reviews/books where appropriate \[rarely web pages\]), tracing the historical development of the ideas and giving the reader pointers on where to go for more information and related work and later refinements, with references cited throughout the text (enough to make it clear what references go with what results). (**Note:** you may re-use diagrams from other sources, but all such usage must be _explicitly credited_; not doing so is [plagiarism](http://writing.mit.edu/wcc/avoidingplagiarism).) Model your paper on academic review articles (e.g. read _SIAM Review_ and similar journals for examples).

Frequently asked questions about the final project:

1.  _Does it have to be about numerical linear algebra?_ No. It can be any numerical topic (basically, anything where you are computing a conceptually real result, not integer computations), excluding algorithms for discretizing PDEs.
2.  _Can I use a matrix from a discretized PDE?_ Yes. You can take a matrix from the PDE as input and then talk about iterative methods to solve it, etcetera. I just don't want the paper to be about the PDE discretization technique itself.
3.  _How formal is the proposal?_ Very informal—one page describing what you plan to do, with a couple of references that you are using as starting points. Basically, the proposal is just so that I can verify that what you are planning is reasonable and to give you some early feedback.
4.  _How much code do I need to write?_ A typical project (there may be exceptions) will include a working proof-of-concept implementation, e.g. in Julia or Python or Matlab, that you wrote to demonstrate that you understand how the algorithm works. Your code does _not_ have to be competitive with "serious" implementations, and I encourage you to download and try out existing "serious" implementations (where available) for any large-scale testing and comparisons.
5.  _How should I do performance comparisons?_ Be very cautious about timing measurements: unless you are measuring highly optimized code or only care about orders of magnitude, timing measurements are more about implementation quality than algorithms. Better to measure something implementation independent (like flop counts, or matrix-vector multiplies for iterative algorithms, or function evaluations for integrators/optimizers), although such measures have their own weaknesses.

Lecture Summaries and Handouts
------------------------------

### Lecture 1 (Feb 6)

* [pset 1](psets/pset1.pdf) and accompanying [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mitmath/18335/blob/master/psets/pset1.ipynb), due Friday Feb. 15.
* [Newton's method for square roots](notes/newton-sqrt.pdf) and accompanying [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mitmath/18335/blob/master/notes/Newton-Square-Roots.ipynb).

Brief overview of the huge field of numerical methods, and outline of the small portion that this course will cover. Key new concerns in numerical analysis, which don't appear in more abstract mathematics, are (i) performance (traditionally, arithmetic counts, but now memory access often dominates) and (ii) accuracy (both floating-point roundoff errors and also convergence of intrinsic approximations in the algorithms).

As a starting example, considered the convergence of Newton's method (as applied to square roots); see the handout and Julia notebook above.

**Further reading:** Googling "Newton's method" will find lots of references; as usual, the [Wikipedia article on Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method) is a reasonable starting point. Beware that the terminology for the [convergence order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence) (linear, quadratic, etc.) is somewhat different in this context from the terminology for discretization schemes (first-order, second-order, etc.); see e.g. the linked Wikipedia article. Homer Reid's [notes on machine arithmetic](http://homerreid.dyndns.org/teaching/18.330/Notes/RootFinding.pdf) for [18.330](http://homerreid.dyndns.org/teaching/18.330/) are an excellent introduction that covers several applications and algorithms for root-finding. For numerical computation in 18.335, we will be using the Julia language: see this [information on Julia at MIT](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit).

### Julia tutorial (Feb 8: 5pm in 32-141) — optional

**Handout:** [Julia cheat-sheet](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit/blob/master/Julia-cheatsheet.pdf), [Julia intro slides](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit/blob/master/Julia-intro.pdf)

On Friday, 8 February, at 5pm in 32-141, I will give an (attendance-optional!) Julia tutorial, introducing the [Julia programming language and environment](http://julialang.org/) that we will use this term. Please see the [tutorial notes online](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit/blob/master/README.md).

Please **bring your laptops**, and try to install Julia and the IJulia interface first via the abovementioned tutorial notes. Several people will be at the tutorial session to help answer installation questions. Alternatively, you can use Julia online at [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/) without installing anything (although running things on your own machine is usually faster).

### Lecture 2 (Feb 8)

* [notes on floating-point](notes/lec8handout6pp.pdf) (18.335 Fall 2007; also [slides](notes/lec8.pdf))
* Julia [floating-point notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mitmath/18335/blob/master/notes/Floating-Point-Intro.ipynb)
* some [floating-point myths](notes/fp-myths.pdf)
* notes on the accuracy of [floating-point summation](notes/naivesum.pdf)

New topic: **Floating-point arithmetic**

The basic issue is that, for computer arithmetic to be fast, it has to be done in hardware, operating on numbers stored in a fixed, finite number of digits (bits). As a consequence, only a _finite subset_ of the real numbers can be represented, and the question becomes _which subset_ to store, how arithmetic on this subset is defined, and how to analyze the errors compared to theoretical exact arithmetic on real numbers.

In **floating-point** arithmetic, we store both an integer coefficient and an exponent in some base: essentially, scientific notation. This allows large dynamic range and fixed _relative_ accuracy: if fl(x) is the closest floating-point number to any real x, then |fl(x)-x| < ε|x| where ε is the _machine precision_. This makes error analysis much easier and makes algorithms mostly insensitive to overall scaling or units, but has the disadvantage that it requires specialized floating-point hardware to be fast. Nowadays, all general-purpose computers, and even many little computers like your cell phones, have floating-point units.

Went through some simple examples in Julia (see notebook above), illustrating basic syntax and a few interesting tidbits, in particular on the accuracy of summation algorithms, that we will investigate in more detail later.

Overview of **floating-point** representations, focusing on the IEEE 754 standard (see also handout from previous lecture). The key point is that the nearest floating-point number to _x_, denoted fl(_x_), has the property of _uniform relative precision_ (for |_x_| and 1/|_x_| < than some _range_, ≈10308 for double precision) that |fl(_x_)−_x_| ≤ εmachine|_x_|, where εmachine is the relative "machine precision" (about 10−16 for double precision). There are also a few special values: ±Inf (e.g. for [overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow)), [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN), and ±0 (e.g. for [underflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_underflow)).

**Further reading:** [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating Point Arithmetic](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.22.6768) (David Goldberg, ACM 1991). William Kahan, [How Java's floating-point hurts everyone everywhere](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf) (2004): contains a nice discussion of floating-point myths and misconceptions. Trefethen, lecture 13. Homer Reid's [notes on machine arithmetic](http://homerreid.com/teaching/18.330/Notes/MachineArithmetic.pdf) for [18.330](http://homerreid.com/teaching/18.330/) are another nice introduction to this material.
