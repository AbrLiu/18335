% Usage: [x, residnorm, residnorm2] = CG(A, b, x, nmax, tol)
%
% Performs nmax steps of conjugate gradient to solve Ax = b for x,
% given a starting guess x (e.g. a random vector).  A should be
% Hermitian positive-definite.  Returns the improved solution x.
%
% Stops whenever nmax steps are performed.
%
% residnorm is an array of length nmax of the residuals |r| as
% computed during the SD iterations.  residnorm2 is the same thing,
% but using |b - A*x| instead of via the updated r vector.
